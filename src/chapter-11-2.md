* Visualize success and positive outcomes to boost confidence
* Be aware of nonverbal habits that may convey negative messages, such as crossing arms or avoiding eye contact.

Job seekers should also be aware of the nonverbal cues of others during the interview process. This can provide valuable insight into how the interviewer is responding to your answers and overall demeanor. Consider the following:

* Pay attention to the interviewer's body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice
* Adjust your responses and nonverbal cues based on the interviewer's reactions
* Ask clarifying questions if you're unsure about the interviewer's response or nonverbal cues.
